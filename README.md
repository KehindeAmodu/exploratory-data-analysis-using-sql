# exploratory-data-analysis-using-sql
Exploratory SQL Analysis Project
Objective

The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis using SQL, aimed at uncovering insights and patterns from a relational database. The project focused on understanding the structure, relationships, and behavior of key data entities through systematic exploration and analysis.

**Project Overview**

This exploratory SQL project was designed to simulate real-world analytical workflows — beginning with understanding the database schema and progressing toward deeper performance, trend, and segmentation analysis. The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful insights that could guide data-driven decisions.

Key Exploration Areas
**1. Database Exploration**

Examined the overall database structure, including tables, relationships, and data types.

Identified primary and foreign keys to understand entity relationships and data integrity.

Conducted data profiling to assess completeness, uniqueness, and consistency.

**2. Dimension Exploration**

Analyzed categorical dimensions such as region, customer type, and product category.

Investigated hierarchies (e.g., country → state → city) to identify distribution patterns and relationships.

**3. Date Exploration**

Utilized SQL date functions to analyze data across time periods.

Explored seasonality, monthly and yearly trends, and temporal gaps.

**4. Measure Exploration**

Defined key performance measures (e.g., sales, profit, quantity).

Assessed measure distributions, averages, and variances across different dimensions.

**5. Magnitude Analysis**

Identified entities contributing the highest and lowest values for key metrics.

Ranked products, customers, and regions by sales and profitability.

**6. Ranking & Change Over Time**

Implemented SQL window functions (RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()) to evaluate performance changes over time.

Measured growth rates and rank shifts between periods.

**7. Cumulative Analysis**

Used cumulative aggregates (SUM() OVER()) to calculate running totals and progressive performance.

Built cumulative views for revenue, orders, and customer acquisition.

**8. Performance Analysis**

Benchmarked actual metrics against targets or averages.

Identified top-performing and underperforming categories based on KPIs.

**9. Part-to-Whole Analysis**

Measured the contribution of individual segments to overall totals (e.g., product share of total sales).

Visualized proportional relationships using percentage breakdowns.

**10. Data Segmentation**

Segmented data by customer demographics, geography, and behavior patterns.

Conducted cohort-style grouping to analyze retention and engagement.

**11. Reporting & Insight Generation**

Compiled SQL outputs into structured reports, put the report as a view suitable for dashboard integration.

Summarized findings with actionable insights on trends, outliers, and performance drivers.

**Tools & Skills Used**

SQL Dialect:  Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (adjust based on your project)

Techniques: Joins, CTEs, Subqueries, Aggregations, Window Functions, Date Functions

Focus Areas: Data Quality Assessment, Trend Analysis, Segmentation, KPI Evaluation

**Outcome**

This project demonstrated advanced proficiency in SQL for data exploration and analysis. It resulted in a clear understanding of database dynamics, key business drivers, and patterns across time, categories, and segments — laying the foundation for deeper analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling.
